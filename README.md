#42's FRACT-ol

A graphical project using the x11 graphics library, specifically the
campus' "minilibx".

It generates colored mandelbrot, julia, and a monochrome sinking ship,
with two attempts of extra fractals which function despite the limitations
imposed by the campus, performance can be improved greatly by replacing
my built-in maths functions with functions found inside complex.h.
